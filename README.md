#  Hello, I'm Cyril!

Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm currently on a learning journey to become a **Computer Engineering student**, and this space serves as my digital notebook, where I document every small step forward in coding and development.

##  What I'm Working On

Right now, I'm focusing on **general C programming**. I'm taking time to understand the **basics of input/output, variables, identifiers, and math operations** like `sqrt()`, `pow()`, `fabs()`, and more using the `math.h` library. My recent commits are part of a personal commitment to **build discipline through daily practice**, even if the code is simple or imperfect.

You can find a recent example here:
>  [Room Temperature Logger and Health Tracker (C)](https://github.com/cYRIL-cpe/BeginnerPractice)  
> A basic exercise using `scanf`, `fgets`, and some math functions to log data â€” no conditionals or loops yet, just focused on mastering inputs and outputs.

## ðŸ”­ What's Next

In the near future, I plan to:

- Explore **conditional statements and loops** in C
- Move toward **Embedded C** and **Microcontroller programming**
- Begin working with **hardware interfaces** and possibly **Arduino or STM32** platforms

## ðŸ“š Why I Push My Code

Even if itâ€™s not complex or production-ready, every commit I make reflects a lesson learned or a problem solved. I believe in learning in public â€” to track my growth, stay motivated, and hopefully inspire other beginners who are afraid to start.

## ðŸš€ Final Goal

To become a **Computer Engineer** who understands both hardware and software â€” building things that solve real-world problems using **embedded systems, electronics, and efficient programming**.

### ðŸ™Œ Letâ€™s Connect!
If youâ€™re also learning or working in Embedded C, feel free to reach out. Iâ€™m always open to connecting with fellow learners or mentors.
I am a single Filipino btw. 18 years old and single
